Talks and seminars
==================

[My](https://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~ncsg3/) intention is to put up slides and the code (latex/R/C) for some of the talks I give. Typically, the slide latex file is called `lecture.tex` which can be built using `pdflatex` or the `Makefile`. The code for the any figures in the talk is in the directory `graphics`.

### Inference

 * Bayesian experimental design ([repo](https://github.com/csgillespie/talks/tree/master/exp-design))

### Stochastic simulation

 * An overview of the tau-leap algorithm ([repo](https://github.com/csgillespie/talks/tree/master/tau-leap), 
 [slides](https://github.com/csgillespie/talks/blob/master/tau-leap/lecture.pdf?raw=true))
 
 * Stochastic simulation of chemically reacting systems using multi-core CPUs ([repo](https://github.com/csgillespie/talks/tree/master/multi-core), 
 [slides](http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~ncsg3/html5talks/multicore))


### R

  * Object oriented programming with R (S3 classes) ([repo](https://github.com/csgillespie/talks/tree/master/S3-classes),
